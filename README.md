# Pool Chemistry Application

## Project Overview

This application serves as a digital tool and logbook for managing the chemistry of public pools. It allows users to:

- Add and log chemical readings (alkalinity, chlorine content, pH) for specific pools
- Determine if measurements are within acceptable ranges
- Receive alerts for out-of-range readings
- View and filter historical data
- Save and load pool logbooks

## Motivation

As a lifeguard, I noticed inefficiencies in our current paper-based system for managing pool chemistry. This digital solution aims to streamline the process, improve data tracking, and potentially prevent unexpected pool closures due to chemical imbalances.

## Features

- Add chemical readings for different pool types
- View current readings for all pools
- Maintain separate history lists for each pool
- Save and load pool history from files
- Receive alerts for out-of-range chemical levels


## User Guide

1. **Add New Pool Reading**: 
   - Click "Add New Pool Reading"
   - Specify pool type (hottub, shallowpool, lanepool)
   - Enter chemical readings

2. **Filter Readings**: 
   - Click "Filter Readings By Pool"
   - Specify pool type

3. **Save Logbook**: 
   - Click "Save Pool Logbook"

4. **Load Logbook**: 
   - Click "Load Pool Logbook"

5. **Visual Feedback**: 
   - A graphic appears briefly after adding a new reading
